# DoReMiTraSup

This repository contains a use case for the DoReMiTra manuscript, which 
will be rendered into the Supplementary Information.

To run the analyses reported in the `DoReMiTra_Supplementary_Analysis.qmd` notebook,
simply open it in an RStudio IDE session or any equivalent tool. 

A rendered version of that notebook is also included as a snapshot.
